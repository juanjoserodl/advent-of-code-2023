# Advent of Code 2023

## Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, solved using Python. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a variety of skill sets and challenge types.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each day's challenge is in a separate folder, named `day-xx`, where `xx` is the day number.
- Inside each `day-xx` folder, you'll find:
  - `input/`: A directory containing `input.txt` with the puzzle input.
  - `part-one.py`: The Python script containing the solution for part one.
  - `part-two.py`: The Python script containing the solution for part two.
